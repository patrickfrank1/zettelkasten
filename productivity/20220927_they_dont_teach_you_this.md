- follow a few good players (of the game of life) and learn as much from them as possible
- standard education teaches you how to follow everyone else, what is 'acceptable', prepares you for a regular 9-to-5 job
- for building a business: learning by doing is more effective than learning from books:
  - constantly work yourself 'out' of the business, so you don't get stuck
  - for every task you do, think about how to delegate it
  - mundane work: build character and discipline while mastering the craft, then leverage systems to scale
  - you can delegate what you don't understand, but once you understand you should delegate
  - passion and finance need each other, so that your passion can grow and nobody can take it away
  - always think about vertical integration: own as much of supply, production and marketing as possible
  - behave like the leader you'd want to lead while leading others
  - IQ can get you into the game, but EQ will help you master it

1. Simplify: good marketing doesn't feel like marketing or selling
2. Multiply: time + leverage (money, energy) = freedom
    - time is working for or against you / are you experiencing life or selling your time?
    - people who do more are not actually doing more, they are leveraging
    - think about how much you should make per hour and outsource any activity that takes more time than it's worth
    - align with your clients
    - narrow your focus
    - say no
    - create something of value
    - calendar everything
    - automate rigorously
3. Diversify: everything requires the same entry point process
    1. you don't know how to do something that you need for yourself
    2. investigate and understand
    3. make decision what you want out of it
    4. decide what tools or people will make it work for you
    5. put mechanisms into place to hold yourself accountable
