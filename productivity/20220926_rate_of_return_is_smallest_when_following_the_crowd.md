1. Simplify: are you swimming upstream or downstream?
    - are you fighting resistance or going with the flow?
    - fighting for followers in a saturated market = resistance
    - early adopter innovating = going with the flow
2. Multiply: find a few multidisciplinary thinkers you can learn from, learn about:
    - nutrition. mindset and mental health
    - holistic and alternative medicine
    - individualism, critical thinking and strategy
    - investing, budgeting and taxation
    - building and managing wealth
    - spirituality and meditation
    - energy and time management
    - self-love, honesty, respect and communication
    - emerging markets and technology
3. Diversify: monetize your future
    - build in a way that allows your work to be invested in over the long run
    - build recurrent income streams
    - internet democratizes, decentralizes and helps capture value
