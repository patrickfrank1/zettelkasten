- used to examine long-term consequences of our decision making
- failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is a cause of bad decisions
- never just take the first available option, always take a break and think

Definition:

1. First-order thinking
    - have an opinion about the future
    - fast and easy
    - look for something that solves the immediate problem without considering consequences
2. Second-order thinking
    - thinking in terms of interactions and time
    - thinking about side-effects of the decision made
    - unusual: consider options, that others haven't considered

How to implement second order thinking?

- Question: And then what?
- Question: How are important parts of the ecosystem going to respond?
- consequences in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years
- list of positive/negative consequences
- also consider options that have first order negative, second order positive effects
