- highly correlated with success in work and life

Why is consistency important?

- gives direction
- creates long term, sustainable results
- makes us reliable
- but makes us also predictable
- in health: makes us more resilient
- in relationships: set expectations and priorities
- in business: measurable results

Three systems to achieve consistency:

- systems for time
- systems for energy
- systems for money

Systems for time, our most valuable resource:

- calendaring, scheduling, prioritization
- allows you to keep track on what you spend most of your time on
- focus on essential tasks: vital few instead of trivial many

Systems for energy:

- produce more energy by living a balanced life
- meditation and journaling
- exercise (daily)
- sleep (8 hours, not too long, not too short)
- nutrition (protein rich, fiber rich, less carbs and fat, lots of water)
- takes good care of your body as it is your operating system

Systems for money

- have a budget
- track expenses
- understand your business cash flow

Simplify:

- consistency means we are prepared for new opportunities

Multiply:

- consistency compounds
- systems compound the compounding rate

Diversify:

- over-scheduled life is not worth living
- under-scheduled life has no direction
