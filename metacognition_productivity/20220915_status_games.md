## Avoid playing status games

- seek wealth, not status
- purpose of wealth = freedom
- purpose of status = your rank in the social hierarchy
- wealth is a positive-sum game
- status is a zero-sum game
- people who are playing status games are trying to up their own value at your expense

Why to avoid status games:

- actively pursuing validation of others takes a lot of time
- actively pursuing your purpose takes less time and benefits you more
- appearance to execute does not equal ability to execute

Instead pursue wealth games:

- these promote your abilities, building yourself
- create value for yourself and others
- earns you a return in the process: good reputation, respect, peace, abundance and solid cash-flow

Simplify:

- don't project an outward image to impress others
- don't oversell everything
- don't over consume

Multiply:

- focus on delivering value to your audience
- don't pay attention to industry or competition

Diversify:

- status games are a rat race
- wealth games keep you free, sovereign

## Are the status games you're playing helping you or hurting you?

- we all play different status games: political, income, intelligence, athletic, fashion, social media...

Questions to ask yourself if you are playing:

- does it gain you or loose you money?
- does it make you healthier or less healthy?
- does it benefit others or only yourself?
- do you feel good, even if you don't win?

## How to avoid status games

What it is and why people play it:

- battle over anything to gain superiority over other people
- boosts the ego
- social signalling

How to identify the players:

- do they have a name for their peer group?, e.g. bitcoin-maximalist, flat-earther
- are they ever able to change their opinion on the topic of interest?
- is their opinion their identity?
- do they only argument ad hominem?
- is the field controlled by veterans?
- do they tolerate questions?

Why to stay away?

- you get stuck in the middle of the pyramid
- you can't give up, because you have invested too much
- you can't reach the top either
- it's a zero sum game, instead focus on something that is not zero sum, like creating value

What can I do to keep away:

- raise a point, not a voice
- keep a open mind: talk to people who hold a different opinion, and listen
- have strong opinions, but weakly held
