- dereaming provides deep immersion and mental flexibility as a psychedelic trip
- safer than a psychedelic trip
- active dreaming can be practiced daily, just like meditation

## What is active dreaming

- any earnest attempt to engage with your dreams
- methods include
	- dream journalling
	- discussing dreams with another person
	- advanced techniques like lucid dreaming

## Comparison with psychedelics

- similarities include
	- visual hallucinations
	- confused logic
	- complex emotions

### Physiology

- large doses of psychedelics can induce dream like hallucinations
- recend experiments provide evidence for comparability between REM sleep dreams and LSD or psiocylibin trips
- LDs facilitates REM sleep when administered during or before sleep
- DMT induced (REM) eye movement

### Predictive processing

- psychedelics seem to work by relaxing priors (softening core beliefs)
- purpose of psychedelic therapy is harnessing the belief relaxation to archieve healthy revision of pathological prior beliefs

- something similar seems to appear in dreaming states
	- we accept bizarre dream imagery
	- balance between top-down and bottom-up brain functions changes
	- attention is directed toward internally generated cognitive processes
	- perdiction errors are minimized by higher order layers
	- in contrast to wakefulness where sensory input is also constrained by lower level layers
- nightly dreaming may be a process of neural annealing
	- radically different training set from what we experience during waking hours
	- diurnal cycle: fitting to tasks during the day, avoiding overfitting during the night via semi-random walk (why tho?!)

### Advantages and disadvantages

- advantages psychedellics
	- make contact with reality (dream world in contrast is completely isolated from reality)
	- therapist can intervene and redirect attention
	- can carry an intention into the (and out of) the experience
- advantages dreams
	- isolation keeps you safer during the experience
	- lucid dreaming may help you to carry some intention into the experience
	- can be safely practiced daily

## Comparision with meditation

- direct comparisons of dreaing and meditation are much rarer than comparisons of dreaming and psychedelics
- state of lucid dreaming is known in both disciplines, c.f. lama Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche: The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep
- both practices might mutually reinforce and benefit each other

- advantages meditation
	- closer connection with the waking self
	- easier to carry intention into your meditation
	- very approachable for beginners
- advantages dreams
	- much more flexible sates of mind (include extreme emotional experiences), while meditation is low affect

## Other remarks

- more research on dreaming needed, current research has no statistical power
- lucid dream researcher Stephen LaBerge has shown that over-the-counter alzheimer drug reliably induces lucid dreams
