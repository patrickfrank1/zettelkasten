Philosophy:

- patterns of life are formed by contrast
- harmony and health are created when contrasting aspects are in balance
- the middle point "Dao" is the tranquility found in the center of all events
- when we leave the center we take on aspects of yin and yang
- yin and yang are not opposites but complementary
- existence is never static, so yin and yang are always in flux
- yin in chinese = shady side of a hill or stream

Yin: dark, cold, passive, inside, solid, slow, right, dim, downward, substance, water, matter, mysterious, female, moon, night, earth, even, dragon

Yang: light, hot, active, outside, hollow, rapid, left, bright, upward, function, fire, energy, obvious, male, sun, day, heaven, odd, tiger

1. Yin Contains Yang:

- yin contains yang, and also yin is always found within yang
- in yoga practice, even in yang style asanas we carefully watch our breath which is a yin aspect

2. Yin Becomes Yang:

- yin becomes yang, and yang transforms into yin
- transformation can be slow or rapid
