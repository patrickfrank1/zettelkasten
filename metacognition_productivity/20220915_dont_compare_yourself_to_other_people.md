Reasons comparing yourself to others is a bad habit:

1. You will want friends to fail
2. Signal bias/survivorship bias
3. Everyone has different circumstances
4. Hinders you creating an abundance mindset
5. Boosts your insecurities

Instead:

- compare yourself to your past self
- to see progress or regressions
- compare yourself to others to learn from them or draw inspiration
