tags: outreach, pr, luck surface area, publishing, networking

- increase number of opportunities for good luck to strike
- work in public enables other people to see it
- build a public reputation, track record
- concept "luck surface area": degree to which you do something you're passionate about combined with the number of people you reach

Typical obstacles to overcome:

1. you're doing things, but think it's not worth sharing
    - look at what you are doing and what is circulating in the community
    - is it more difficult than the average blog post?
    - don't think that you are smarter than everyone, think about how people want to know all that stuff
    - project doesn't need to be done done, share the journey, lessons learnt,  outlook
2. you can't get started
    - start with tiny scoped projects
    - don't aim for perfection
    - don't be afraid to deep dive into a topic
    - concepts you learnt at work (taken out of company context)
