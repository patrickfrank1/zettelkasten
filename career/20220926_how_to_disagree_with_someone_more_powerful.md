- natural to avoid confrontation, but not always the best thing to do

Consider:

- be realistic about the risk of negative consequences
- also think about the risk of not speaking up
- gauge the peer groups opinion
- decide whether to wait before moving forward

How to move forward:

- seek a conversation in private, not in public
- identify a shared goal: alignment is key, confrontation is counter productive
- ask permission to disagree: give psychological safety / control
- stay calm: talk slow and clear, confident body language
- summarize your counterparts point in your own words to get a mutual understanding
- don't make a judgement: cut out adjectives and stay objective
- stay humble: state your well-informed opinion, add guiding phrases like 'thinking out loud here'
- stay open to other points of view
- acknowledge their authority
