- wealth != money, wealth enables you to live a free and healthy live
- if you work for hourly compensation, then your input is closely linked to your output
- you don't get wealthy renting out your time, because that does not compound

Instead:

- become more self reliant
- value your time and other peoples time
- solve problems, then automate the process with technology
- consider the motives of other people, don't be gullible or naive

Simplify:

- live below your means
- simplify your lifestyle
- avoid lifestyle inflation

Multiply:

- give society what it does not know how to get
- scale it so that everyone can have it

Diversify:

- leverage product and media
- create passive income streams
