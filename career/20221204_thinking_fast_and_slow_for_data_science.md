## Current topics in data science (Dec 2022)

- technical debt in ML systems (cf. Sculley, et. al., 2015)
- MLOps, seen as natural progression of DS to evolve into
- this, however is counterproductive, since it hinders experimentation

## Analogy to Daniel Kahnemann's: Thinking, Fast and Slow

System 1: fast, intuitive, automatic, emotional, associative, unconscious

- needed for data driven experimentation
- to come up with creative solutions to the problem at hand
- curiosity driven insights
- find the right questions to ask
- develop a strong model of the world your dat set is meant to represent

System 2: slow, deliberate, conscious, logical, analytical

- needed when building MLOps systems
- tasks that are more similar to classical software engineering

Challenge:

- these systems work very differently
- training in both is required to become a successful data scientist

## Food for thought

### MLOps:

- current mantra: bring all machine learning models to production
- reality: maybe some models should fail in experimentation phase and never make it to production
- therefore rethinking in the industry is required

### Experimentation:

- tragically undervalued
- considered R&D work, but really is crucial for any projects success
- experientation part always comes short in the face of deadlines

### Become a better data scientist:

- MLOps is only one of two very large mountains, the other is experimentation
- climb the experimentation mountain first, then the MLOps mountain
- climb the experimentation mountain by being curious and exploratory
- climb the MLOps mountain by being strategic and methodical
