url: <https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/> \
tags: productivity, work, documentation, career

- write a document with all the tasks/jobs you did
- you can share that with your boss and colleagues
- section with goals for next year

Reasons:

- you don't remember everything you did
- your boss doesn't remember/know what you did
- your boss needs reasons to argue for a raise
- notice patterns in your daily work
- what did I do? In which direction do I want to go?

How:

- list accomplishment
- maybe 1 or 2 bullet points
- like a raw version for your cv
- include big picture and context
- don't leave out the grunt work
- include mentorship, collaboration, etc.
