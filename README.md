# zettelkasten

Saving notes to articles I read and found interesting

## Remarks

This is not quite a real [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), since I don't plan to link notes to each each other at this point in time.

This collection is intended to be used as an encyclopedia and can be searched via tags or just just full text.
But the repository also doubles as my blog and the summarized articles herein mostly reflect my current interest.
Of course it contains summaries for now, so the content is not original. I might add a real blog section at a later point in time.
