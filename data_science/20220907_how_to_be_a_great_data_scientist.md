- know the fundamentals
- then learning by doing

Data expertise:

- understand data _sample_ (of the population)
- is dataset representative, biased, covering the population distribution?
- which features to use and which to discard (always ask for All features first)

Deep knowledge of statistics:

- how to preprocess, analyze, explore, visualize your data

End-to-end knowledge:

- to deliver value, model needs to be operationalized into a product/system
- at least have a high level knowledge of tools used for deployment
- be able to effectively communicate with other stakeholders and engineers

Knowing when to simplify:

- solving business problems doesn't always require cutting edge Algorithms and technologies
- focus on delivering value, keeping models stable and up to date
