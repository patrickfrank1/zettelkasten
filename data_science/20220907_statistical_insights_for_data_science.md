tags: bias, data distribution

Sources of bias:

- Convenience bias: only including samples that are easy to get
- Non-response bias: distortion by too many N/As
- Selection bias: only select samples that support your case
- Volunteer bias: again specific audience, that is interested in the topic already

Data distributions:

- many standard tests like T-test or ANOVA only apply to normally distributed data
- otherwise could work on bootstrapping methods
- or log-transform or otherwise transform the data
