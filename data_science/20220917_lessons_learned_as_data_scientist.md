Do you even need machine learning:

- end users don't really care how problem is solved
- ml for the sake of it will be more expensive, take longer and be more complex

What is the root cause problem?

- really understand the underlying issue first, don't start with a solution too quickly
- do a workshop with the customer first
- ask many questions, try to understand everything
- spend a lot of time on EDA before training a model
- present findings and confirm hypotheses in workshops
- keep it as simple as possible

Consolidate your code into modules, not python notebooks:

- simple coding best practices
- jupyter notebooks have a purpose in EDA

Tell a story the customer cares about:

- consider target audience
- don't go too technical just because the model is cool
- talk about business context instead
- emphasize business value
- refer back to the agreed upon problem statement
