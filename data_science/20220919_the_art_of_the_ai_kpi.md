Preliminary considerations:

- data is not the new oil, it's a resource that is exponentially increasing
- the cleaning and maintenance are upfront costs, but value generation is continuous
- no limit on how many times you can transform data, it's value will continually increase
- before starting need a clearly defined business strategy
- this will give rise to objectives and key results
- start with the business goal and work backwards
- align ai with your business strategy

Key performance indicators for analytics:

- seven ways in which KPIs boost returns:
  1. help to lead and manage (structure)
  2. align the entire organization
  3. provide holistic view of the customer
  4. inform decision making
  5. data sharing across business units
  6. leaders should focus on 3 to 6 KPIs
  7. serve as data sets for machine learning
- find KPIs by answering questions:
  1. What do you want to know?
  2. How much do you need to know?
  3. Why do you want to know this?
  4. What is the impact of knowing vs. not knowing?
- typical KPIs:
  - financial: revenue growth, cash flow, burn rate, gross profit
  - customer: engagement rates, nps, acquisition cost, conversion rates, churn rate
  - support and service: turnaround time, time to resolve, sla compliance, quality
  - employee: churn rate, satisfaction, engagement
  - governance, risk and compliance: percent compliance to process, audit compliance, non-security incidents

Data and analytics KPIs:

- business impact of data and analytics: "How much has the needle moved because of ai, data and analytics?"
- indirect impact: maybe you haven't yet discovered the right metrics
- leading: some outcomes predict other outcomes, e.g. low employee nps -> hire more hr -> productivity increased this year
- anecdotal: by collecting a significant amount of individual reports
- direct: collect data points and quantify change in variables/metrics
- touched: data and ai might be invisible, but touch may aspects/departments of a company

Concrete examples:

- monitor time from insights to action
  - how quickly can your organization derive insights from data and turn them into action
  - because customer behavior changes quickly, competitors catch up
- measure data quality
  - conclusions can only be reliable if data is valid
  - quantify data trustworthiness
- track data literacy levels
  - across functions and enterprises
  - up-skill workforce to make better informed decisions
  - train how to retrieve, analyze and derive insights from data
- quantify data, analytics and AI risk
  - possible way to misuse the product
  - company exposure to misuse or data leaks
  - do you follow all regulations and industry standards
